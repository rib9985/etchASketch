# A Etch-A-Sketch game for The Odin Project curriculum

## Project Details

The main purpose of this project is **implement** a *HTML, CSS, JS* browser version of **Etch-A-Sketch**. The implementation used a grid which was further manipulated in the DOM using a JS script to control several proprieties.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**

## Methods Used & Implementation

**GRID CREATION**

    > Functional approach with the use of iteration to provide a basic grid size. 

    > CSS was used to populate a canvas container with fixed-sized *divs* by using the grid property

    > Event and DOM methods were used to capsulate the canvas into the HTML document

**COLORING/CHANGING SQUARE STATES**

    > Functional approach with event listeners to listen for a specific user-driven event (click or hover)

    > HTML was used to create a color picker input type to provide the value for state change



## Overall Learning Experience
At the time, this was a quite difficult project to tackle. One of the main problems I faced was how to store state changes in functions and pass on new, ever-changing event values to current values. In this sense, the project allowed me to explore DOM manipulation and CSS styles in a more event-driven fashion.
